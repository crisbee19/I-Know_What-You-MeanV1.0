# I-Know_What-You-MeanV1.0
Steganography program: I Know What You Mean!

This program was created to encode or decode messages using randomized words!

We wanted to take the concept of steganography and create something fun with it

**************************************** PROCESS ****************************************

1. Message decoder

This method takes the first letter of any random word you input and joins it into a single word!

Example:

Heap elf lake land other

Translates to:

Hello

2. Message encoder

This second method takes any phrase, word or sentence and encodes it using randomized words.
This is helpful when you want to send someone a message, but prefer to hide it's content

Example:

im bored

Translates to:

Ink Magic Boat Ocean Rabbit Earth Dice
